The effect of psychoeducation in reducing the burden of caregivers from mental disorders
Effectiveness of support in psychoeducation in reducing the burden for families of patients with psychological distress
The intervention group consisted of 89 individuals, received six home visits by psychologists with a standardized intervention model for each mental disorder. Mental disorders found and selected for the study were: schizophrenia, depression, mental retardation, alcohol and drug dependence and mood disorders. The topics covered were: information about what is and what is psychoeducation, information about the disorder user based on scientific data translated into a language understandable to the family, often making use of figures for better understanding, emotional support given all meetings ( listening to stories ), stimulating the user autonomy, information on how the family must make when a user enters a crisis, the organization along with the family of head phones for emergency and other relatives and friends, and family relationships circle of friends, the stimulation of individual leisure activities and the presence of the user, encouraging the distribution of care with other family members, identification of resources and social facilities to guarantee the rights and full citizenship. The caregiver was also asked clinics and psychic implications and adherence to family group in CPC, use of medications and other therapeutic resources. The control group consisted of 88 subjects received the standard support from CPC, not receiving visits from psychoeducation.

-Abdominal sacrocolpopexy (n 45): forty-five women will undergo surgery for abdominal route: subtotal abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal vault fixation in the sacral promontory with mesh and vaginal perineorrafia when necessary. Women will be evaluated thirty days, six months and one year through objective analysis by using the surgeon and genital prolapse POP-Q classification, proposed International Continence Society, and through subjective evaluation through questionnaires quality of life.
-Vaginal sacrospinous fixation (n 45): forty-five women will undergo surgery for vaginal: vaginal hysterectomy, vaginal vault fixation of the sacrospinous ligament bilaterally and correction of cystocele with mesh and perineorrafia when necessary. Women will be evaluated thirty days, six months and one year through objective analysis by using the surgeon and genital prolapse POP-Q classification, proposed International Continence Society, and through subjective evaluation through questionnaires quality of life.
Women with stage uterine prolapse 3 and 4. Women menopausal between 55-75 years. Are only included postmenopausal women because the genital prolapse is a condition more prevalent in this age group and has developed differently when it occurs in premenopausal women. To homogenize the group, we will select only postmenopausal women. Sample size target will be 90 women with uterine prolapse stage three and four.
Women who do not wish to participate in the study. Women with cognitive impairment and illiterate and unable to understand the questionnaires. Women who have or have had gynecological cancer. Women with pelvic floor surgery antecedent.
Women undergoing colpofixation the sacrospinous ligament with screen placement on the anterior wall will have objective and subjective cure rates of apical vaginal prolapse lower than women who underwent abdominal technique colpopromontofixação at the end of the study. We will use to objectively evaluate healing the classification of POP-Q, as recommended by the International Continence Society. For subjective evaluation, we will use a questionnaire about quality of life in genital prolapses, validated for the Portuguese. Because it is a randomized clinical trial, because of risks with respective 95% confidence interval for the same will be calculated. The homogeneity between the groups, the chi-square statistic is calculated and to assess objective cure according to the classification of POP-Q will be performed analysis of variance with repeated measures.      
The colpopromontofixação present higher morbidity with increased operative time, blood loss and immediate complicaçãos than colpofixation the sacrospinous ligament with mesh placement in the anterior wall, but this útlima present higher rates of late complications such as vaginal mucosa erosion, screen display and dyspareunia. Because it is a randomized clinical trial, the risk ratio with respective 95% confidence interval for the same will be calculated. The homogeneity between the groups, the chi-square statistic is calculated and to assess the outcomes will be performed analysis of variance with repeated measures.

Effectiveness of dental care for prevention of nosocomial respiratory tract infections among intensive care patients.

Effectiveness of dental care for prevention of nosocomial respiratory tract infections among intensive care patients

Experimental group contained 147 patients that were submitted to dental care provided by a dental surgeon, as needed by the patient, four to five times a week until discharge from the intensive care unit, additionally to the routine oral hygiene. Dental care included vigorous teeth brushing with a child toothbrush, tongue scraping, removing calculus, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment of caries, teeth extraction, and topical application of chlorhexidine.  Although chlorhexidine 2.0% gel was preferable, and used by both semi-conscious and unconscious patients, its inherent bitter taste precluded it to be used by fully conscious patients, who used chlorhexidine 0.12% solution. 
Control group contained 147 patients who were submitted only to routine oral hygiene. Routine oral hygiene was provided by the intensive care unit nurse staffing three times a day and consisted of mechanical cleaning of the oral cavity with an spatula wrapped with gauze, followed by topical application of chlorhexidine 0.12% or 2.0%, according to the level of consciousness, as described above.
Patients of both sexes, aged between 18 and 100 years old, admitted to the ICU of the study, if they had a expected time of hospitalization exceeding 48 hours.

Effect of the pH, consistency and quantity of fluoride of the toothpaste in the fluoride retention on enamel surface
Effect of the pH, consistency and fluoride concentration of liquid dentifrices in caries control of fluoridated and not fluoridated áreas: randomized clinical trials 
Nineteen adults took part in the study. All the paticipants will take part in the three interventions after a washout period of one week between them.  Interventional group 1 - will use a liquid dentifrice (DLE), with 1,100
ppm F, low fluidity pH 7.0 [carboximetilclulose 2.2% (CMC)]
Healthy volunteers, aged between 20 and 35 years old, not using orthodontic appliances and that have not been involved in other studies 3 months before the present research.
Volunteers using orthodontic appliances; volunteers using other fluoridated products.
Significantly higher concentrations of fluoride in the biofilm fluid were found 1 hr after the toothbrushing compared to 12 h (p <0.01). However, no significant differences were seen between the dentifrices with different viscosities.
Significant differences between the dentifrice could be found if their viscosity was quite different. Higher concentrations of F in dentifrices can lead to significant differences if their viscosity was very different. Higher concentrations of F in the dentifrices can lead to different results regarding the effect on the incorporation of F in the biofilm according to the viscosity.

Treatment for pain reduction and the size of heel spur
Evaluation of effects of iontophoresis and phonophoresis whit acetic acid in the treatment of plantar fasciitis calcifying
Manual therapy: All segments were subjected to a standard intervention that consisted of joint mobilization techniques of talocrural (slip anteroposterior and posteroanterior), grade I or II of Maitland, seeking relief from pain. We performed two types of mobilization, once every two seconds, one minute, with 4 series and repetition interval of 30 seconds between each set, as described below:
- Mobilization of the posterior talus: a patient positioned supine with the segment to be treated outside of the litter. One of the hands of the therapist holds the proximal tibia and fibula to stabilize the leg and the other clings to the anterior talus and applies a force in the anteroposterior direction.
Medical diagnosis of plantar fasciitis associated with the presence of limestone deposits in the plantar fascia and / or Achilles tendon, which was confirmed by radiological examination.
Exclusion criteria consisted of allergy to acetic acid; history of cancer, trauma, and recent surgery on his ankle, as well as open lesions and alteration of pain sensitivity in the same region, pregnant or lactating, using any kind of treatment for plantar fasciitis calcifying , Presence of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis
Size of calcification: the area of the calcaneus was used as reference to estimate the size of calcification. For the calculation, X-rays of the ankle before and after study were used. The x-ray images were digitized and created a script in Matlab was used to measure the area. The three measurements and average used for analysis, and measurements were performed by two investigators blinded with regard to the research group that belonged to each segment of the ankle.
Pain: pain intensity at rest and in motion, was assessed using a Visual Numerical Scale (VNS). The VNS was applied at initial assessment and each session (pre and post treatment), by the same evaluator, previously trained to perform the procedure. Pain was also measured by the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which was applied at baseline and last treatment session, by the same evaluator.

120 patients will undergo endovascular procedures: 40 for the treatment of lower limb ischemia caused by aortoiliac stenosis classified according to the consensus for the management of peripheral arterial disease (TASC) A or B with an indication for angioplasty as the inclusion criteria; 40 for the treatment of lower limb ischemia due to stenosis femoropopliteal TASC A or B with an indication of angioplasty as the inclusion criteria and 40 for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with indication for endovascular repair. Of these procedures, half chosen randomly by computerized simple random, will be submitted to the endovascular procedure in question using only iodinated contrast and the other half will be submitted to the endovascular procedure using carbon dioxide (CO2). There will be no CO2 injection in the aortic arch or cerebral territory. The patient previously evaluated at the Hospital Municipal Dr. Moses Deutsch will be referred to the operating room of the Albert Einstein Hospital where it will be performed under general anesthesia with intubation or blockage associated with sedation, and the same in the supine position (DDH).The femoral artery will be punctured with Seldinger technique unilaterally or bilaterally, according to the indication for the procedure. By using the guide wire will be one or two sheaths inserted in a retrograde manner. Through the introducer, is manually injected retrogradely 50 ml of CO 2, in obtaining images of the apparatus module CO2 Philips mode subtraction angiography. In angioplasty for obstructive disease, with the module roadmap will be held the passage of the guidewire through the stenotic region or occlusion, and dilatation balloon angioplasty specific. After angioplasty, there will be a new injection of contrast for the evaluation of partial results. As appropriate, will be held stent placement, in which case there will be a last angiography with 50 ml of CO2. In endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, there will be a first injection of CO2 for the study of the neck of the aneurysm and stent implantation. After the release of the entire stent, a new angiography is performed by injection of CO2 for the control of surgical outcome. In all procedures will be performed to measure pressure through the femoral sheath prior to angioplasty, after angioplasty and stent after the placement. During the use of CO2 as contrast medium, with questions at the trial of such factors as the extent of injury, indication of repair, endoleak, leak, rupture or thrombosis by arteriography will be performed by manual injection of iodinated contrast.Of course this amount of contrast is measured.

Effectiveness of lithium microdose in the treatment of Alzheimer
Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, longitudinal study to evaluate the effectiveness of lithium microdose in the treatment of Alzheimer
Intervention group: 116 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer
Will be included in the study: patients clinical diagnosed with Alzheimer
Will be excluded in the study patients who don’t have a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer
The primary outcome will be to determine whether the microdose lithium will stabilize the cognitive decline  of Alzheimer's disease patients, for that will be used clinical tests, such as: cognitive abilities, anxiety behavior and autonomy to do daily activities.  Stabilization of cognitive decline will be considered statistically different when significance level was lower than 5% (p<0.05) between treated group and placebo group. The data will be collected each three months and analysed at 12, 24 and 36 months.    Cognition status will be clinically assessed by means of tests such as: MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); CDR – Clinical Dementia Rating; ADAS-cog – Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; NPI-C - Neuropsychiatric Inventory – Clinician Rating Scale; Functionality and anxiety will also be clinically assessed by the Barthel index and GAI (Geriatric Anxiety Inventory), respectively.  
The secondary outcome will be to evaluate the possible collateral effects of lithium microdose, thereunto will be measured considering the follow parameters (indication of reference levels): the lithium blood levels, which will be quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); markers of kidney function, quantified by analysis of Urea (13 a 43 mg/dL) and Creatinine (0,6 a 1,3 mg/dL); markers of thyroid function, quantified by levels of TSH (0,27 a 4,20 uUI/mL) and free T4 (0,93 a 1,7 ng/dL) hormones and markers of liver functions, quantified by levels of GGT (Men<73UI/L and Women<38 UI/L), AST (8 a 33 U/L), ALT (Men:10 a 40 U/L and Women: 7 a 35 U/L), total bilirubin (0,3 a 1,2 ng/dL) and fractions (direct: up to 0,2 ng/dL e indirect: up to 1,0 ng/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (Men:90 a 360 U/L and Women: 70 a 290 U/L) of the all patients.  The treatment will be considered safe if the levels of markers and analytes remain within normality levels.

Association between Aerobic Capacity and Sleep in Elderly
Association between Cardiorespiratory fitness and Sleep in Elderly
Two interventions were carried out:

1. Cardiopulmon
Aged 60 years or older; Men and women; body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kg / m²; Diagnosed with hypertension; No use of beta-blockers; Considered irregularly active (IPAQ adapted for the elderly).
Smokers / recent ex-smokers (
Cardiorespiratory response was considered our primary outcome. For its evaluation was performed Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test. Participants were instructed to eat light foods usually up to 2 hours prior to CPET, instructed to continue taking the medication in doses and usual hours, avoid physical activities and refrain from drinking alcohol or stimulating foods (with caffeine) 24 hours before testing. It was also requested that used comfortable clothes and shoes suitable for movement on the exercise bike. Before the test, the volunteers remained seated on the bike for about two minutes for evaluation and record blood pressure at rest through period auscultation technique which also received guidelines on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The technical procedures followed the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians for testing in cycle ergometers. Briefly, each patient underwent sitting at home a peripheral saturation recording (SpO2), electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure and then started the ramp protocol in cycle ergometer (CG-04, Inbrasport, Porto Alegre, Brazil) with a rate of increase of constant load, starting without charge and 5-12 W / min increase rate up to the maximum tolerance limit (determined by the inability to continue pedaling frequency of pedaling 60 rpm). Subjects were encouraged through verbal stimuli to a test succeeded length between 8 and 12 minutes where every 2 minutes was recorded PA, ECG and SpO2. After the effort, the patients were monitored for 3 minutes pedaling without charge. The results of the cardiopulmonary stress test are shown in Table 1 (attached). In it, we see that both groups performed the exercise protocol with a similar workload (SAH: 78 (66-96) W / min; SAH + OSA: 85 (47-114) W / min, p> 0 , 05). Still, the cardiorespiratory variables and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were similar in both the groups (p> 0.05). On the other hand, SAH group + OSA had lower FCrec2 in relation to older people without obstructive sleep disorder (SAH: 41 (38-54) bpm; SAH + OSA: 34 (27-45) bpm, p<0.05).
The quality of sleep was the secondary endpoint of this study, assessed by polysomnography. All participants underwent an examination portable polysomnography and the diagnosis of the presence or absence of OSAS was performed and laudado by medical sleep specialist. The presence of OSAS was confirmed by the IAH. The survey was conducted during a full night in the participant's residence in spontaneous sleep and without sedation. Monitoring of variables was performed using a portable breathing monitor Embletta type (Embla, Embletta® Gold, USA), previously validated, as well as instruction on its operation. The Embletta monitor is able to continuously monitor the pulse oximetry to detect respiratory efforts (plethysmographic strap thoracoabdominal), measuring the airflow (this pressure sensor nasal cannula pressure) and record snores; Moreover, the FC is continuously measured by the pulse wave read by the oximeter, as well as electrodes C3, D1, D2 mentonianos were affixed to detect brain and muscle activity. The DSatO2 event was defined as the amount of reduction in SaO2 4% / h. As can be seen in Table 2 (attached), the SAH + OSA group had higher AHI values(SAH: 2.0 (0.8 to 3.3) events / h; SAH + OSA: 22.9 (17 , 9 to 27.5) events / h, p = 0.02) and DSatO2 (SAH: 1.7 (0.9 to 4.3) events / h; SAH+ OSAS: 11.5 (2.9 - 21.6) events / h, p = 0.02) when compared to the SAH group. There were significant differences in sleep architecture, characterized by a total time of greater sleep in OSAS + SAH group in relation to the SAH group (p <0.05).
Individual nutritional follow-up in cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation program improves diet quality and reduces abdominal circunference: randomized clinical trial 
Nutritional Follow-up in cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation program: randomized clinical trial in a specialized service
Intervention group: 17 participants from cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation program received individualized food planning prescribed in a personalized way and individual follow-up consultations with nutritional education, adjustments in food planning when necessary, weight measurement and  survey of food consumption. Control group: 19 participants from cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation program received widespread nutritional counseling and follow-up visits with measurement of weight and were inquired on food consumption. In both groups we used the Mediterranean diet as food standard. The duration of the study was approximately 90 days with six follow-up visits done biweekly with the two groups: intervention and control. The type of nutritional intervention was offered randomly.
Being 35 years of age or more, integrate cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation program
Being 35 years of age or less, living in nutritional monitoring or under use of medication for weight loss, present plasma triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl, have frequency of less than 75% in the appointments, or do not attend the initial / final evaluations and, recurrence of Acute myocardial infarction, stroke or other event that causes their withdrawal

Outcome found: there was a more adequate intake of unsaturated fats in the group receiving individualized nutrition prescription and nutritional education, reducing the intake of hydrogenated fat and sodium, and increased dietary fiber consumption in the same group. The intake of cholesterol reduced in both groups. The food intake evaluation was carried out by the inquiry of food consumption "24-hour Food Recall". The food Consumed and quantified in household measures sizes was entered and calculated in DietWin Personal nutrition software (version 2010 Carmen Suzana Bassoa Reinstein, POA, RS). The intrinsic sodium and processed foods intake was calculated using the software mentioned. For analysis of the extrinsic sodium the value of 2.0g of sodium chloride (salt) per main meal (breakfast / dinner) was adopted, and an additional 1.0g in case of the addition of salt to the salad or very salty food consumption habits. Ideal values were set at: total fat from 25 to 35%, polyunsaturated fat lower than or equal to 10%, monounsaturated fat lower than or equal to 20% and hydrogenated fat lower than 1% of  the total caloric value; cholesterol lower than 200mg, fibers from 20 to 30g, and sodium 2g per day, based on the IV Brazilian Guidelines on Dyslipidemia and Prevention of Atherosclerosis of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology, 2007 and the VI Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension 2010.
Outcome found: There was no positive effect of both interventions on blood pressure . Blood pressure was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope and classified according to the Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 2003.
Functional and strength training in parkinsonians
Influence of functional and strength training on neuromuscular adaptations, functionality quality of life, and intracellular mechanisms associated with the muscle weakness in elderly with parkinson
The strength and functional training protocol will have an intervening period of 12 weeks, 3 months, and drills will be performed twice a week. Every four weeks training loads will be adjusted progressively during the 12-week intervention. The intensity is determined by the zone of maximum repetition, that is, the load used in each exercise must be maximal in order to set the number of repetitions. Will be conducted at 5 exercises two for the upper limb, three for lower limb in both types of training, but in functional training accessories are added that cause instability, such as ball, spaghetti, dyna disk among other. 
All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional.
All patients must present the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson
Patients who present symptoms of dementia, depression, joint problems, hypertension and stroke will be excluded from the study.
The primary endpoint of this study is to raise the test, go back and commonly known as timed up and go. In this test the patient has to get up from a chair, walk three meters around an obstacle, and sit back in the chair again. In this test the time is measured which it takes the patient to the route previously described. The analysis of the primary endpoint will be a comparison of the test stand, go back and forth on all patients randomized into three treatment arms: group strength training, functional training group and control group. This will be used for an analysis of mixed models, taking the three treatment arms and the time before and after training as fixed factors and patient as random factor, the level of significance is p <0.05. If the analysis of mixed models for the primary outcome reveal a statistically significant difference between the groups that receive different interventions and the control group demonstrate that both trainings are effective in improving time to get up, walk back and forth in patients with Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, if the analysis of mixed models provide a statistically significant difference between the group and the group strength training functional training demonstrate that an intervention is more effective than another in improving time to get up, walk back and in patients with disease Parkinson's. It is expected that patients in group functional training after three months of training to obtain a better performance on the test stand, go back and compared with patients in group strength training, since this type of training works motor control, proprioception neuromuscular and aspects that are vital for patients with Parkinson's disease.
Muscle strength of the lower limb is defined as the maximum load that the patient can lift once. This will be measured by the test in one repetition maximum leg press exercise, which indicates the maximum strength of the patient. The muscle mass of the lower limb is measured using magnetic resonance imaging, which indicate the cross-sectional area of ??the quadriceps femoris muscle of the patient. The severity of motor symptoms will be measured by the  Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III. There are 14 items and the score on each item ranges from 0 to 4, and the maximum value indicates greater disease involvement and minimum normal. The daily activities will be measured by the  Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II. There are 13 items and the score on each item ranges from 0 to 4, and the maximum value indicates lower performance in the execution of daily life and the minimum optimum performance. The quality of life will be measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire Parkinson's Disease PDQ-39. There are 39 questions each question ranges from 0 to 4. The issues are referred to how often the individual has passed difficulties arising from Parkinson's disease for the last month and assesses mobility, activities of daily living, emotional state, social stigma, social support, cognition, communication and discomfort physical. Lower scores indicate better quality of life while higher scores indicate poorer quality of life. The balance will be assessed by two instruments. The first is the Berg Balance Scale to evaluate the static and dynamic balance. This scale consists of 14 tests that assess the ability of the individual to sit, stand, reach, turn around yourself, look over their shoulders, stand on one foot and go upstairs. The score is 0 - unable to perform the task 4 - very skilled. The total score will be 56 points, with index equal to or less than 36 points will be assigned a 100% risk of falls. The second instrument is the force platform to assess the static equilibrium and will be used the area of ??center of pressure of patients. The area of ??the center of pressure will allow estimating the dispersion of the center of pressure along the maintenance of upright encompassing the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral simultaneously in the calculation. Cognition will be assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. This scale assesses the varieties of cognitive changes that patients with Parkinson's disease present and has a maximum score of 30 points. The presynaptic inhibition and inhibition  reciprocal are inhibitory mechanisms that are related to spinal motor control. The spinal inhibitions, will be evaluated using the H-reflex of the soleus muscle. The H-reflex is determined in two conditions: control or test - only the H-reflex muscle soleus muscle is obtained with a stimulus applied to the tibial nerve, and conditioning - the H-reflex of the tibialis anterior muscle is generated by stimulation of the common peroneal nerve, before the H-reflex of the soleus muscle. The common peroneal nerve stimulation, conditioning stimulus, will be held before the test stimulus interval of 100 ms and 0-4ms in order to recruit the Ia afferents and activate spinal inhibitory pathways. It is expected that patients in group functional training after three months of training to obtain statistically significant higher percentages of presynaptic inhibition and reciprocal inhibition compared with patients in group strength training, since this type of training works motor control and proprioception. The ACTN3 gene associated with muscular performance. For this there will be two blood samples before and after the training period. There will be a disposable needle into the vein of the arm of the patient and will be removed from 10 ml of blood, for analysis of alpha-actinin gene also known as 3-ACTN3 so that the patient should be at rest and fasted for 8-12 hours . Gene expression of alpha-actinin-3 may be linked to muscle weakness in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Evaluation of Three Methods to Predict Difficult Intubation during Anesthesia
Evaluation of Three Multivariate Models for Predicting Difficult Intubation During Anesthesia 
It is an observational, single arm, not blind study with 200 patients.
A multivariate airway evaluation will be performed in 200 patients that will undergo surgery under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The goal of this evaluation is the prediction of difficult intubation during anesthesia. This evaluation will be performed in accordance with three multivariate models described by three different authors. The results of these evaluations will be compared with the laryngoscopy classification at the moment of intubation. In this way we willbe able to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each method in the same group of patient.

Effect of Physical Exercise and Respiratory Therapy After Cardiac Surgery
Impact of Physical Exercise Associated to CPAP Application on Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Postoperative
Patients evaluated in the preoperative period (clinical and physiotherapy assessment) of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery are randomly assigned to one of the two parallel study groups. The randomization is done in blocks in a 1:1 ratio, by opaque, sealed, shuffled envelopes that are opened in the preoperative period. After the surgery, from the first postoperative day (1PO-already extubated patients), patients participate in a program of physical therapy: 1st group- Physical Exercises (Control): early rehabilitation cardiorespiratory program , with breathing exercises (consisting of bronchial hygiene and reexpansion pulmonary exercises) and global exercises (starting with upper and lower limbs active-assisted exercises in 1PO, progressing to walking and fligth of stairs in 5PO) without the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 2nd group- Physical Exercises associated with CPAP (CPAP): breathing exercises and global exercises identical to 1st group, with all the physical exercises associated to CPAP application. For both groups, patients who do not get discharged on the 5th postoperative day continue the protocol until the 7th stage, with increase in ambulation time (5 min each day) and the amount of fligth of stairs. Patients are evaluated in the preoperative and postoperative regarding pulmonary function tests (spirometry and manovacuometry), heart rate variability, peripheral oxygen saturation and respiratory pattern (via respiratory inductive plethysmography, a device that performs noninvasive measurements of ventilatory pattern).

Comparison of training with video games and conventional physiotherapy on balance, gait, breathing, memory and quality of life of the elderly: a randomized clinical trial
Comparison between training with kinect adventures game system and sensory-motor functional training in control postural, gait, ability cardiorespiratory, cognition and nursing quality of life: randomized controlled trial

This study it is a randomized clinical trial, which will have an experimental group that will exercise using virtual reality through commercial games video game and an active control group will make a sensory motor training circuit which will be described below. The experimental group (Virtual Reality) will have 16 community elders that is healthy elderly, eight male and eight female, aged 60-80 years. The control group (sensory motor circuit training) will have 16 community elders that is healthy elderly, eight male and eight female, aged 60-80 years. Totaling 32 community elders.
Virtual reality group (experimental group): group of 16 patients will practice four games Kinect Adventure program! Xbox 360 developed by Microsoft. The virtual reality group sessions will be held individually, lasting an hour each session, twice a week for seven weeks. Each game will have five attempts, and the first three attempts carried out with the help of a physical therapist to correct the movements and posture of patients through the manual and verbal commands directing. The last attempt will be made without interference from the physical therapist for the record score and further analysis of the performance of the participants. Patients remain standing in front of a TV 50 
Seniors will be selected aged 60-80 years; of both genders; which did not show neurological and orthopedic disorders that promote disability of the elderly remain in bipedalism and wade unaided or cardiovascular disease uncompensated such as: angina; heart failure; high blood pressure decompensated; show no signs of cognitive impairment; the normal or corrected visual acuity measured by Snellen chart; normal or corrected hearing is clinically assessed by the whisper of the test; who did not have previous experience with the Kinect system and accepting to participate by signing the Informed Consent and Informed.
The elderly will be excluded that during the study period submit any clinical change that makes it impossible to perform physical exercises in standing position as: cardiorespiratory; orthopedic or neurological disorders; seniors who are missing for more than three consecutive sessions without replacement.
The primary endpoint will be the performance on the Mini bestest test, which is an assessment tool of postural control, consists of 14 items that focuses on the dynamic equilibrium, comprising four domains: anticipatory postural adjustments (transition from the sitting position posture to biped, stay on fingertips, one foot); postural responses (in four different directions- previous, posterior, lateral-lateral); sensory orientation (equilíbrio- with open eyes; instável- surface with eyes closed, tilt-with eyes closed); and balance during walking (with change of speed, horizontal head movement, spins, hurdles associated with the dual task). And the 14 items are: evaluation of postural change from sitting to standing; stand on tiptoe; standing on one leg; correction with compensatory step forward, backward, side; eyes opened on a firm surface; eyes closed, foam surface; slope with closed eyes; change in gait speed; walk with head movements; floor and turn on the axis; pass over obstacles and Get up and Go timed double task. Each item is scored from zero to two; a score of zero indicates that a person is unable to perform the task, while the score two is normal. The best score is the maximum amount of points, 32 points. The test reliability coefficients for items and individuals ranging from .91 to .98, indicating stability and the ability of reproduction of the measures in subsequent applications. It is expected that the patients after interventions (video game or functional sensory motor training) present values of at least two points higher after the interventions proposed. That is, so there is a significant clinical difference one has to get two points from the initial score.
The secondary endpoint of the study will be: marching, cognition, cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life, mood will be evaluated by the respective tests and questionnaires. The march will be evaluated by the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), walk test ten meters (TC10M). Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a tool for functional mobility assessment, evaluates the individual's ability to modify the march in response to changing demands of certain tasks in elderly individuals with impairments in balance. It consists of eight tasks involving gait in different sensorial contexts, which include flat surface, changes in gait speed, horizontal and vertical movements of the head, go over and around obstacles; turn on your own body axis, up and down stairs . Items are scored from zero to three, in which 0 indicates severe impairment and 3 ordinary skill, with a maximum score of 24. In order to have clinical significance after the interventions (game or functional sensory motor training) gain of 1.90 points is required to total sample; gain of 1.80 points in subjects with a score lower than 21 points and won 0.60 in subjects with scores above 21 points. Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) is an instrument that assesses postural stability under various conditions in the march. These conditions are: walking on a flat surface; changing gait speed; march with horizontal movements of the head; march with head nodding; turn and spin on its own axis; go over obstacles; up and down stairs; walk back; walk with reduced base and floor with eyes closed. Each item is scored from zero to three: a score zero indicates that the person is unable to perform the task, while a score indicates three levels of normality. The best score is the maximum amount of points, and 30. In order to have clinical significance after the interventions (game or functional sensory motor training) the gain of at least 10% of the initial value is required. Random example: initial value 25 points the final value has to be at least 27.5 points. The walk test ten meters is an instrument used to assess the spatial and temporal attributes kinematic gait. It assesses the speed of the march, by measuring the time that a person needs to travel a distance of ten meters. So that there is clinically significant after the intervention (game or functional sensory motor training) it is necessary to gain at least 0.05 m / s. Cognition is evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) which is a brief cognitive evaluation test, specifically developed for the assessment of milder forms of cognitive impairment, which provides a quick measure of global cognitive status of the subject. The MoCA evaluate a wide range of cognitive domains, such as: executive functions; visuospatial ability; short-term memory; language; attention, concentration; working memory and temporal orientation and espacial.A score of this test may vary from zero to thirty points. To have clinical significance after intervention (game or functional sensorimotor training) the gain of at least 10% of the initial value is necessary. Random example: initial value 25 points the final value has to be at least 27.5 points. The quality of life will be assessed by quality of life questionnaire WHOQOL-OLD elderly that has aimed to measure the individual's satisfaction with his life and his perception of the influence that the diseases cause in your life. This questionnaire consists of 24 items with response from one to five, divided into six areas. Domains are: autonomy (independence of the elderly; be able and free to live autonomously and make their own decisions.); operation of directions (impact of the loss of runs senses the quality of life.); past, present and future activities (satisfaction with the achievements in life and goals to be achieved.); social participation (participation in activities of social life, especially those linked to the community.); death and dying (worries and fears about death and dying.); and intimacy (being able to have intimate and personal relationships. The maximum score achieved is 100 points. In order to have clinical significance after the interventions (game or functional sensory motor training) the gain of at least 10% of the initial value is required. Example random: initial value 80 points the final value has to be at least:. 88 points the mood will be assessed by the geriatric depression scale 15 (GDS-15) is an instrument used to detect mood and depression in the elderly, consisting of 15 issues, to which the individuals answered yes or no, exploiting the individual has or no signs of depression. for each response indicative of depression added to 1-point. the scale is from 0 to 15 points, so that the the higher the score, the greater the signs of depression. in order to have clinical significance after the interventions (game or functional sensory motor training) decreased score of at least 10% of the initial value is required. Random example: initial value 10 points the final value has to be at least: 9 points. Cardiorespiratory capacity will be assessed by the six-minute step test (TD6) that has aimed to verify the cardiorespiratory capacity. The subject is instructed to walk up and down the step for six minutes, aiming at the highest possible number of steps at this time (free rhythm) and can merge the lower limbs, without the support of the upper limbs, which remained stationary throughout the body. oxygen saturation is checked, heart rate, blood pressure and symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue of the lower limbs were found at rest and immediately after the tests and the recovery period. For analysis, we used only test performance (number of ascents on the step). To have clinical significance after intervention (game or functional sensorimotor training) the gain of at least 10% of the initial value is necessary. Random example: initial value 100 steps the final value has to be at least 110 steps.
Effectiveness of propolis in reducing the symptoms of rheumatic diseases in humans
Propolis effectiveness of therapy in the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatism: Clinical Trial
One hundred and twenty adults (aged 18-70) living in the State of Alagoas, Brazil, with rheumatic pains were recruited from the waiting list in public clinics in the state of Alagoas. After an initial assessment, eligible individuals (n = 87) were randomized into two groups. The evaluation consisted of questions about the intensity of pain using a numerical rating scale of pain (NRS), followed by assessment of joint range of motion affected with the universal goniometer, and manual muscle strength testing using the Lovett scale . After collecting all the data was handed the numbered bottle followed the guidelines on the intake. At this time the final assessment was agreed between researchers and participants.
The final evaluation after 10 days, also followed the same procedure baseline sequence, however beginning with the observation of the vial available at the first time to ensure that the product had been used properly. The volunteers were instructed to continue with their normal activities during the period between assessments. All these tests were performed by the same examiner.
Inclusion criteria were the clinical diagnosis of tendinitis; bursitis or osteoarthritis and presence of pain resulting from rheumatic disease at the time of initial evaluation. Participants did not do any treatment for rheumatism two weeks before the start or during the clinical trial; or intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the previous three months.
We excluded patients with hypersensitivity to bee toxins, obesity, pregnancy and lactation, gastrointestinal bleeding history, gastric perforation; kidney disease, liver disease; current history of alcoholism, use of anticoagulants; implant prosthesis or pacemaker; severe chronic uncontrolled (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and other diseases that by its nature or the proposed treatment could interfere with the assessment).
Improvement in muscle strength tested by manual muscle strength testing, with power increased in a statistically significant way, pre and post intervention.
No reported side effects, checked complaint from the researcher. It was reported no effect throughout the research.

Open single-arm clinical trial without randomization or placebo control. Study with the purpose of observing the variation in the haemoglobin (Hb) values after a period of at least 4 weeks of a ‘before-after’ intervention with daily oral iron and to define the final diagnosis of the functional iron deficiency.
The participants are women with a low-risk singleton pregnancy, between 18 and 35 years old, with gestational age between 12 and 32 weeks and Hb values greater than or equal to 7.0 g/dL and less than 11.0 g/dL. The recruitment procedure is a consecutive series of patients whose prenatal routine exams shown anemia (Hb 
Hemoglobin concentration at least 0.7 and below 11.0 g/dL. Gestational age between 12 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. Low-risk pregnancy.
Hipersensibility or intolerability to ferros sulfate. Mental disease that precludes to understand the intervention. Unknowing the gestacional age. Another cause of anemia: sickel cell disease, talassemia, spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukemias,  anemia of crônic disease. Sistemic infeccious diseases: human immunedeficiency virus, siphilis, urinary infeccion, leucocytosis. Tobacco, alcohol or other drugs use.
It is expected that the responsiveness to therapeutic test with oral iron (final diagnosis of functional iron deficiency) achieves an increase of at least 0.55  Z-score of haemoglobin after a minimum of 4 weeks treatment and an intake of at least 1200 mg of elemental iron (effective total dose). The primary outcome will be measured by the difference between the pre-treatment haemoglobin concentration (erythrogram collected on time-zero) and the post-treatment haemoglobin concentration (erythrogram collected on monthly revaluations 1, 2 or 3).
It is expected that at least 20% of participants complain about one or more of following adverse effects: abdominal pain/abdominal cramps, diarrhea (increasing number of evacuations or reduction of the stools consistency), constipation (reducing number of evacuations or hardening of stools), nausea, vomiting and heartburn (epygastric burning or epygastric pain). Their presence were defined as the appearance of the symptoms after the beginning of the intervention and are  being evaluated every 30 days according to pregnant women´s information by a standardized questionnaire and recorded in the pregnant women´s individual form.
Effect Of Muscle Strengthening on The Upper Limb Motor Recovery After Stroke
Effects of Functional and Analytical Strength Training on Upper-Extremity Motor and Functional Recovery After Stroke: a Randomized, Controlled Trial
Twenty-eigth patients of both sexes, aged between 18 and 90 years with chronic hemiparesis (6 months after stroke) will be randomly (by lottery distributing computer-generated) into 2 groups: Group I - FS(Functional Strengthening and GroupII - FA (Analitical Strengthening. In the group I (n=14), the pacients will submitted a functional strengthening program, which consist of movement or functional task-oriented, plus cargo. Individuals who are part of this group should remain seated and raise objects of different sizes and weights of a lower position (positioned next to the seat member in an activity that remains when the elbow remains extended to the side of the body to achieve the object) to a higher position (table positioned in front of a patient when the shoulder flexion reaches 60 degrees). The positions will be tailored to each patient in order to enable optimal biomechanical alignment. The functional task will be trained so that when the object to reach the level of the table or bank it changed (drop and pick) by another object of the same weight but of different diameter. The exercises are performed three times per week for five weeks, fifteen sessions in total. In the group II (n = 14), the pacients will submitted a program of strengthening analytical, using dumbbells with different weights. The movement will be trained to hold and increase the weight by flexing the shoulder to the 60 degrees repetitive exercises with the dumbbells. The exercises are performed three times per week for five weeks, fifteen sessions in total. Masking: open.

The main between groups analysis demonstrated that the FS group had the largest change in the unilateral task analysis (rate of change of 43%; p=0.04) and in the unilateral total score (rate of change of 46%; p=0.04), compared to the AS group with a rate of change of 13% and 13.5%, respectively. In the follow-up measures, although the rate of change was higher in the FS group, no statistically significant differences were observed. 
The ANOVA for hand grip strength demonstrated a main effect for time (F(1,25) = 12.20; p=0.002). Both groups had an increased grip strength at the outcome (FS group; p=0.03 and the AS group; p=0.002) and the effect remained at follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at the outcome (p=0.32) and follow-up (p=0.7).  There was no difference between groups for shoulder flexion strength neither at the outcome (p=0.43) nor at follow-up (p=0.9). However, both groups showed improvement in strength after each intervention (AS and FS, p=0.001) and at the follow-up (AS, p=0.003; FS, p=0.002).  For active shoulder ROM, a two-way ANOVA only revealed a significant effect of time (F(1,25) = 24.95; p<0.01). No group or time-group interaction effect was observed. The quantitative analysis of intra-group effect demonstrated an improvement of 33% (p=0.003) in the FS group and 26% (p=0.002) in the AS group after the strength protocols. This effect persisted at 10 month follow-up. No difference was identified between groups for the motor assessment (UE-FM) at the outcome (p=0.83) or follow-up (p=0.96). Participants in both intervention protocols exhibited a significant motor recovery in the paretic upper-extremity at the outcome (p=0.001) and at follow-up (p=0.001).  Muscle tone evaluation (Ashworth scale) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both FS (p=0.04) and AS (p=0.03) intervention groups at the outcome and at follow-up.

Effect of cleaning teeth in the levels of c-reactive protein in the blood of patients with severe disease in teeth and bone of the maxilla and mandible
Effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on levels of c-reactive protein in serum of subjects with severe periodontitis
Nonsurgical periodontal therapy, ie, scaling and root planing of the dental bacterial biofilm and subgingival calculus with specific curettes. Subjects with periodontitis were treated in three stages: mechanical periodontal therapy, sites reinstrumentation, and SPT. The first stage was carried out in less than 14 days. One month later, in stage 2, new mechanical instrumentation was performed in patients who persisted with deep pockets, BOP and calculus. At this stage, meticulous scaling and root planing were performed until reaching the following periodontal conditions: PD above 4 mm in at least three or fewer sites, PD above 5 mm in two places at most, PI less than 15% and BOP less than 10%. In Stage 3, subjects were scheduled biweekly or monthly, according to the need to control biofilm formation. SPT was performed for six months. This study is characterized as clinical trial, non randomized, single group, opened, single arm. Minimum age for inclusion: 20 years. Maximum age for inclusion: 45 years.

Primary outcomes: after periodontal therapy, it was noted a decrease in all clinical periodontal parameters and levels of C-reactive protein. The reduced levels of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein after periodontal therapy was of sufficient magnitude to provide a positive change in the risk category for cardiovascular disease. The association between improvement of clinical parameters and c-reactive protein levels in patients with severe periodontitis demonstrates the systemic effects of periodontal infection. All clinical periodontal parameters were assessed by clinical examination with a manual millimetric probe. Levels of c-reactive protein were assessed by blood samples.
Secondary outcomes: it was noted a significant increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and no significant change in other serum lipids after periodontal therapy.

The effects of statins on the progression of cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant patients
Prospective, randomized, controlled study including patients with recent kidney transplant and regularly followed in outpatient post-transplant in the Oswaldo Ramos, UNIFESP. Were selected and randomized 120 patients.  Were constituted 2 arms: rosuvastatin (crestor 10 mg daily) and control without placebo and were followed up for 12 months, and 59 patients in the rosuvastatin group group (10 mg daily of the drug) and 61 patients in the control group (no intervention).
Patients 18-65 years of both sexes were randomized by the computer randomly.
Kidney Transplant for within two months
Age below 18 years or above 60 years, creatinine clearance lower than 30 ml/min, patients prioritized for kidney transplantation and patients who had experienced any cardiovascular events 3 months prior to transplantation. 
In the evaluation of cardiovascular disease after 12 months of intervention, there was no regression of coronary calcification using rosuvastatin, observed by calcium score obtained with CT. A statistical model of generalized estimating equations, which did not find a significance level of 0.05 (; time effect p = 0.70; interaction p = 0.92 group effect p = 0.06) was obtained. There was no difference between echocardiographic parameters or pulse wave velocity analyzed.
There were no differences in cardiovascular mortality or occurrence of cardiovascular disease after 12 months using rosuvastatin. However, in the univariate analysis there was a statistical difference in improvement in renal function, calculated from the MDRD (p <0.001) and stabilization of inflammation, dosed by examining the PCR (p = 0.01) in those patients who used statins in the control group.
